\title{List all content identifiers that have been seen at a given URL}
\usage{
query_history(url, registries = default_registries(), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{url}{A URL for a data file}

\item{registries}{list of registries at which to register the URL}

\item{...}{additional arguments}
}
\value{
a data frame with all content identifiers that have been seen
at a given URL.  If the URL is version-stable, this should be a single
identifier.  Note that if multiple identifiers are listed, older content
may no longer be available, though there is a chance it has been registered
to a different url and can be resolved with \link{query_sources}.
}
\description{
\link{query_history} is the complement of \link{query_sources}, in that it filters a table
of content identifier : url : date entries by the url.
