Title: An Interface for Content-Based Identifiers
Description: An interface for creating, registering, and resolving content-based
             identifiers for data management. Content-based identifiers rely on
             the 'cryptographic' hashes to refer to the files they identify, thus,
             anyone possessing the file can compute the identifier using a 
             well-known standard algorithm, such as 'SHA256'.  By registering
             a URL at which the content is accessible to a public archive, such
             as <https://hash-archive.org>, the content identifier can serve 
             many functions typically associated with A Digital Object Identifier
             ('DOI').  Unlike location-based identifiers like 'DOIs', content-based
             identifiers permit the same content to be registered in many locations.
